## Introduction

Welcome to Chain Breakers! We are Hack to Hope and this project was created as part of the "Code to Protect" hackathon in January 2025 hosted by Code Institute. This hackathon is aligned with National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, and our goal is to shine a light on the realities of human trafficking and empower communities to recognize and respond to potential red flags.

Our project focuses on interactive trafficking scenarios designed to raise awareness and educate users about the warning signs of human trafficking. By presenting realistic situations, we aim to teach people how to identify troubling patterns and learn effective ways to seek help or intervene. Ultimately, we believe that knowledge is a powerful tool in preventing exploitation and safeguarding vulnerable individuals.

### Technologies Used

**Chain Breakers** leverages a combination of modern web technologies to deliver a seamless and engaging user experience. The primary technologies used in this project include:

#### Languages

- **HTML** 
- **CSS** 
- **JavaScript**

#### Frameworks, Libraries, and Programs

To build a robust and scalable platform, **Chain Breakers** utilizes a variety of frameworks, libraries, and programs. These tools help streamline development, enhance functionality, and ensure a smooth user experience.

#### Frameworks

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Django is used for the backend development of **Chain Breakers**, providing a secure and scalable foundation for the application.

#### Libraries

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is used to create dynamic and responsive components, enhancing the interactivity of the platform.
- **Bootstrap**: A front-end framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites. Bootstrap is used to ensure that **Chain Breakers** is visually appealing and accessible across all devices.

#### Programs

- **Heroku**: A cloud platform that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. **Chain Breakers** is deployed on Heroku, allowing for easy scaling and management of the application.
- **GitHub**: A platform for version control and collaboration. The project's codebase is hosted on GitHub, facilitating collaboration among team members and contributors.

By leveraging these frameworks, libraries, and programs, **Chain Breakers** is able to deliver a powerful and user-friendly platform dedicated to raising awareness about human trafficking and modern slavery.

By combining these technologies, **Chain Breakers** is able to provide an informative, accessible, and user-friendly platform dedicated to raising awareness about human trafficking and modern slavery.

### Deployment

#### GitHub Deployment

GitHub is used for version control and collaboration, making it easy for multiple developers to work on the project simultaneously. The codebase for **Chain Breakers** is hosted on GitHub, where contributors can clone the repository, make changes, and submit pull requests. This workflow ensures that all changes are reviewed and approved before being merged into the main branch, maintaining the integrity and stability of the project.

#### Heroku Deployment

Heroku is a cloud platform that allows developers to deploy, manage, and scale applications. **Chain Breakers** is deployed on Heroku, which provides a seamless deployment process and robust infrastructure. By using Heroku, the project benefits from automated deployments, easy scaling, and integrated monitoring tools. This ensures that the application remains performant and available to users at all times.

To deploy **Chain Breakers** on Heroku, the following steps are typically followed:

1. **Create a Heroku App**: Initialize a new application on the Heroku platform.
2. **Connect to GitHub**: Link the Heroku app to the GitHub repository for continuous deployment.
3. **Configure Environment Variables**: Set up necessary environment variables for the application to run.
4. **Deploy the Application**: Push the code to Heroku, which automatically builds and deploys the application.
5. **Monitor and Scale**: Use Heroku's monitoring tools to keep track of the application's performance and scale resources as needed.

By leveraging GitHub for version control and Heroku for deployment, **Chain Breakers** ensures a streamlined development process and a reliable, scalable platform for users.

### Testing
