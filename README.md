## Introduction

Welcome to Chain Breakers! We are Hack to Hope and this project was created as part of the "Code to Protect" hackathon in January 2025 hosted by Code Institute. This hackathon is aligned with National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, and our goal is to shine a light on the realities of human trafficking and empower communities to recognize and respond to potential red flags.

Our project focuses on interactive trafficking scenarios designed to raise awareness and educate users about the warning signs of human trafficking. By presenting realistic situations, we aim to teach people how to identify troubling patterns and learn effective ways to seek help or intervene. Ultimately, we believe that knowledge is a powerful tool in preventing exploitation and safeguarding vulnerable individuals.
