        <p>
            <strong>Welcome to Chain Breakers!</strong>
            We are <strong>Hack to Hope</strong>, and this project was created as part of the <strong>"Code to Protect"
                hackathon</strong> in January 2025, hosted by Code Institute.
            This hackathon aligns with <strong>National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month</strong>, and our
            goal is to shine a light on the realities of human trafficking while empowering communities to recognize and
            respond to potential red flags.
        </p>
        <p>
            At Chain Breakers, we aim to foster understanding, raise awareness, and equip individuals with tools to take
            meaningful action against human trafficking.
            By leveraging education and accessible resources, we believe in the power of knowledge to prevent
            exploitation and protect vulnerable individuals.
